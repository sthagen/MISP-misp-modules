    "description": "A simple DNS expansion service to resolve IP address from domain MISP attributes.",
    "requirements": [
        "dnspython3: DNS python3 library"
    ],
    "input": "Domain or hostname attribute.",
    "output": "IP address resolving the input.",
    "features": "The module takes a domain of hostname attribute as input, and tries to resolve it. If no error is encountered, the IP address that resolves the domain is returned, otherwise the origin of the error is displayed.\n\nThe address of the DNS resolver to use is also configurable, but if no configuration is set, we use the Google public DNS address (8.8.8.8).\n\nPlease note that composite MISP attributes containing domain or hostname are supported as well."
