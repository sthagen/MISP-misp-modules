    "features": "This module takes a domain, hostname, or IP address attribute as input in order to query the Onyphe API. Data fetched from the query is then parsed and MISP attributes are extracted.\n\nThe parsing is here more advanced than the one on onyphe module, and is returning more attributes, since more fields of the query result are watched and parsed."
